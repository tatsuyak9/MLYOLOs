// Simulates an infrared camera by coloring brighter objects red and darker objects blue.
//
// This works by calculating the brightness of the current color, then creating a new
// a new color based on that brightness. If the brightness is lower than 0.5 on a scale of
// 0 to 1, the new color is a mix of blue and yellow based; if the brightness is 0.5 or
// higher, the new color is a mix of yellow and red.
